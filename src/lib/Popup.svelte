  <h1>Welcome to Title City Scapes</h1>
  <br>
  
  <p>Drag an image of an academic title page onto the left section, and hit <code>Process Image</code>. This will run text recognition to try and find all of the words.</p>
  <br>
 
  <p>When this is done, and there are rectangles around the words, press the <code> Build City </code> button to see those shapes come to life. You can drag to move the 3D model, and scroll to zoom.</p>
  <br>

  <p>Click the camera icon in the top right to save an image of your city.</p>

  <br>

  <p>If the text recognition doesnt work perfectly, then you can click the <b>+</b> button to draw your own rectangles in, or <b>-</b> button to drag a selection around any boxes you want deleted. Hit enter in both modes to confirm the box, and click <code> Build City </code> again when finished.</p>
